 <h2>What is the housing issue?</h2>
 <h3>The housing issue in Canada is due to a lack of houses, thus making rent and house prices skyrocket. This is preventing immigrants from coming to Canada because they can’t afford a house to live in. On the other hand, it is preventing the people who are already living here from welcoming immigrants as there aren’t enough houses for them to live in. Houses increased by 46% during Covid-19.</h2>
 <h2>Why does the housing issue happen?</h2>
 <h3>The housing issue happened because of the lack of houses due to the bad use of space and because of the amount of immigrants coming to Canada.</h2>
 <h2>What this housing crisis forces people to do:</h2>
  <h3>The only thing people can do if they don’t have a house is to either take out a mortgage so they could live somewhere while they work to pay off the mortgage, rent a house for a lot of money, or stay somewhere else cheaper and wait until they can eventually afford it. The salaries from jobs aren’t helping either as jobs are paying the same while houses are increasing a lot, making it very difficult to keep up with the increase of houses with your job.</h2>
   <h2>What we can do to help:</h2>
    <h3>To help, we can spread awareness about this issue to the government, who can help by motivating construction of houses, which could be by paying more for the construction of affordable houses and lowering people’s tax. The government could also pay banks to lessen the interest rates in loans when people are building houses as it’ll convince more people to build new houses while paying less money.</h2>
	 <h2>Is the housing issue going to get better soon?</h2>
	  <h3>Currently, it looks like the housing crisis isn’t going to end for the next few years naturally unless more houses are built or there’s less people. Around 3.5 million houses need to be built buy 2030 for housing prices to go back down, but to do that, it’ll cost around 3,500,000,000,000(3.5 trillion), which costs more than Canada’s entire GDP, and there’s probably not enough space for all of that, so the government probably won’t help pay for it. The easier way to resolve this is by stopping people from immigrating here and paying people to move to a different country for maybe 100,000$ instead of having to make a whole new house. This way, there’ll be less people needed to occupy houses.</h2>
